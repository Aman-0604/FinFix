# üìà FinFix: AI-Powered Portfolio Risk Alert System

Welcome to **FinFix**, an AI-enhanced financial query resolution and risk alert system for retail investors. Built on top of the original AI Ticket Assistant by ChaiCode, this project leverages AI to help users get smart suggestions and advisor support for managing mutual funds, SIPs, tax-saving options, drawdown alerts, and portfolio optimization.

  - Generate **AI-suggested financial advice**
- Sends smart alerts and expert suggestions via email
